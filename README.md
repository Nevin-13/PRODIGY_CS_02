This is a simple Python application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a basic randomized 
pixel shuffling algorithm. The application uses a user-defined seed value to control the 
randomness of the encryption and decryption process. This project was created as part of a virtual internship
at Prodigy Infotech.
